# General-Processor-Unit-in-VHDL-Verilog
This project involves designing a GPU with ALUs, FSM, 8-bit latches, a 4-to-16 decoder, and a seven-segment display. Originally in VHDL, I converted it to Verilog to expand my HDL skills. The design was implemented and verified in Quartus II using waveform simulation.
